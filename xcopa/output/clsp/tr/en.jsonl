They often warn against doing so with phrases like \"Gözünü güneşe dikme\" (don't stare at the sun with your eyes) or \"Gözünü kör etme\" (don't blind yourself).\n\nOption (B) is less likely, as most Turkish people are aware of the importance of protecting their skin from the harmful effects of the sun's UV rays, and they generally try to avoid excessive exposure to the sun. Tanning is not seen as desirable or healthy in Turkish culture, so it is unlikely that someone would intentionally expose themselves to the sun for the purpose of getting a tan.\n\nOverall, I would say that option (A) is the more plausible outcome of \"Güneşe baktım\" in Turkish culture."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in commonsense reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [Choice]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on my understanding of Turkish language and culture, I would say that the more plausible option as a result of \"Güneşe baktım\" would be (A) \"Güneş gözümü aldı\" (the sun blinded me).
