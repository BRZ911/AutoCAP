As an expert in multi-lingual understanding in Estonian, I can provide some insights and analysis to help you make the right choice.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the sentence structure and grammar of the sentence \"Õpilane kiirustas raamatu lõpetamisega\". The sentence consists of a subject \"õpilane\" (student), a verb \"kiirustas\" (hurried), and an object \"raamatu\" (book) with an action noun \"lõpetamisega\" (finishing).

The sentence suggests that the student was in a rush to finish the book, but it is not clear why.\n\nBased on the two options provided, we can analyze and eliminate one of the options that seems less plausible. Option (A) \"See tuli raamatukokku tagasi viia\" (It needed to be returned to the library) does not seem to fit the context or the sentence structure.

Therefore, option (B) is the more plausible option.\n\nIn conclusion, as an expert in multi-lingual understanding in Estonian, I would choose option (B) \"Ta laenas selle sõbralt\" (He/she borrowed it from a friend) as the more plausible option to explain the sentence \"Õpilane kiirustas raamatu lõpetamisega\" (The student hurried to finish the book)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in commonsense reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [Choice]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an expert in commonsense reasoning in English, let's analyze the given task step-by-step.\n\nFirstly, we need to understand the sentence structure and grammar of the given sentence \"Õpilane kiirustas raamatu lõpetamisega\" in Estonian.
