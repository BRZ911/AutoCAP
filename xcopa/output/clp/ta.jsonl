Option B is less likely as not everyone in the photograph would necessarily have red-eye if the flash was not used.

Based on the provided options, the more plausible answer would be Option B) \"Waves hit the shore.\"\n\nThis is because the initial phrase mentions the location being at a beach or coastal area (\"கடற்கரையோரம்\"), which implies the presence of a body of water.
