They both mention the marriage between Annette and Amelia Crum Bryant, which took place on September 29, 1874. Additionally, both sentences discuss the fact that they had a daughter. Sentence 1 explicitly mentions that Annette gave birth to a daughter, while Sentence 2 indirectly implies the presence of a daughter. \n\nBased on this analysis, Sentence 1 can be seen as a paraphrase of Sentence 2 as they convey the same information with minor differences in wording.
