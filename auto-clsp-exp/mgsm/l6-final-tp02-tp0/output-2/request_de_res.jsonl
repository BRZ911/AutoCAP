It also has a decent pre-training data proportion.\n\n3. French: Indo-European; Romance; 4.7%\n   - Rationale: French is a Romance language, offering a different language branch for cross-lingual reasoning. It also has a significant pre-training data proportion.\n\n4. Chinese: Sino-Tibetan; Sinitic; 4.6%\n   - Rationale: Chinese is from a completely different language family and branch, providing a diverse perspective for cross-lingual reasoning. It also has a decent pre-training data proportion.\n\n5. Spanish: Indo-European; Romance; 4.5%\n   - Rationale: Spanish, being a Romance language, offers another language from the same branch as French, providing additional support for cross-lingual reasoning. It also has a significant pre-training data proportion.\n\n6. Japanese: Japonic; Japanese; 4.4%\n   - Rationale: Japanese is from a different language family and branch, providing a unique perspective for cross-lingual reasoning.

Its lower pre-training data proportion still makes it a valuable addition for diverse reasoning paths.\n\n3. French: Indo-European; Romance; 4.7%\n   - Rationale: French, as a Romance language, provides a different linguistic perspective compared to German. Its moderate pre-training data proportion adds diversity to the cross-lingual reasoning process.\n\n4. Chinese: Sino-Tibetan; Sinitic; 4.6%\n   - Rationale: Chinese, as a Sino-Tibetan language, offers a completely different language family and linguistic structure compared to German. Its moderate pre-training data proportion adds valuable diversity to the reasoning process.\n\n5. Spanish: Indo-European; Romance; 4.5%\n   - Rationale: Similar to French, Spanish as a Romance language provides a different linguistic perspective compared to German.

Am Dienstag aß sie doppelt so viele Kekse wie ihre Schwester. Ihre Schwester aß am Montag 5 Kekse und am nächsten Tag 13.
