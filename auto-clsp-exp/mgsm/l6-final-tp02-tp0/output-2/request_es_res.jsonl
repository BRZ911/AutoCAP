English: Indo-European; Germanic; 46.2%\n   - Rationale: English is chosen due to its high pre-training data proportion and its belonging to the same language family (Indo-European) and language branch (Germanic) as Spanish, which can facilitate cross-lingual reasoning.\n\n2. Russian: Indo-European; Slavic; 5.8%\n   - Rationale: Russian is selected as it belongs to the same language family (Indo-European) but a different language branch (Slavic) compared to Spanish. This diversity in language branch can provide alternative reasoning paths for cross-lingual understanding.\n\n3. French: Indo-European; Romance; 4.7%\n   - Rationale: French, being a Romance language within the same language family as Spanish, can contribute to a strong cross-lingual alignment and understanding due to their linguistic similarities.\n\n4. Chinese: Sino-Tibetan; Sinitic; 4.6%\n   - Rationale: Chinese is chosen as it represents a different language family (Sino-Tibetan) and language branch (Sinitic) compared to Spanish. This diversity can offer unique reasoning paths for cross-lingual understanding.\n\n5. Italian: Indo-European; Romance; 2.7%\n   - Rationale: Italian, being a Romance language within the same language family as Spanish, can contribute to a strong cross-lingual alignment and understanding due to their linguistic similarities, albeit with a lower pre-training data proportion.\n\n6. Japanese: Japonic; Japanese; 4.4%\n   - Rationale: Japanese is selected as it represents a different language family (Japonic) and language branch (Japanese) compared to Spanish. This diversity can offer unique reasoning paths for cross-lingual understanding, despite a lower pre-training data proportion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTarget Language=[{\"language\": \"English\"}, {\"language\": \"Russian\"}, {\"language\": \"French\"}, {\"language\": \"Chinese\"}, {\"language\": \"Italian\"}, {\"language\": \"Japanese\"}]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "After your language selection, please assign an alignment score for multilingual reasoning aggregation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n1. **Alignment Score Calculation**: For each selected language, assign an alignment score (ranging from 0 to 1).

Chinese: Sino-Tibetan; Sinitic; 4.6%\n   - Rationale: Chinese is chosen as it is from a different language family (Sino-Tibetan) and will provide a diverse reasoning path for cross-lingual understanding.\n\n4. French: Indo-European; Romance; 4.7%\n   - Rationale: French is from the Romance branch of the Indo-European language family, similar to Spanish. This will aid in cross-lingual alignment and understanding.\n\n5. Italian: Indo-European; Romance; 2.7%\n   - Rationale: Italian is also from the Romance branch of the Indo-European language family, providing additional support for cross-lingual reasoning with Spanish.\n\n6.
