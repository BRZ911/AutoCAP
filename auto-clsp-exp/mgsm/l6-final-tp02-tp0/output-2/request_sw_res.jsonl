English: Indo-European; Germanic; 46.2%\n   - Rationale: English is chosen due to its high pre-training data proportion and its belonging to the same language family and branch as Swahili, which can facilitate cross-lingual reasoning.\n\n2. Russian: Indo-European; Slavic; 5.8%\n   - Rationale: Russian is selected as it belongs to the same language family as Swahili, but with a lower pre-training data proportion, providing a diverse reasoning path.\n\n3. Chinese: Sino-Tibetan; Sinitic; 4.6%\n   - Rationale: Chinese is from a different language family and branch compared to Swahili, offering diverse reasoning paths and a different perspective for cross-lingual understanding.\n\n4.
