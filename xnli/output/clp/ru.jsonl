If the passage does not explicitly mention whether Rudolf Giuliani apologized for his handling of the shooting, it can be considered a neutral stance.\n\n(C) Entailment: This option implies that the given statement logically follows from the information provided in the passage. In this case, if Rudolf Giuliani defends his decision in shooting Amadou Diallo, it does not necessarily mean that he apologized for how he handled the incident.
