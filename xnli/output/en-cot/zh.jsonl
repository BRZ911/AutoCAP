The question is asking whether the average industrial index of the Jones is a measure of industrial performance. Then, based on the previous passage, it wants to know if it is true that when the Dow is rising, rich people will buy more. We need to determine whether this statement is a contradiction, neutral, or an entailment.\n\nTo analyze this, we need to examine each part separately. \n\n1. Is the average industrial index of the Jones a measure of industrial performance?\nThe average industrial index, typically referring to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), is commonly used as a benchmark or indicator of the overall performance of the stock market or industrial sector. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the average industrial index of the Jones is indeed a measure of industrial performance. \n\n2. Does the Dow rising lead to rich people buying more?\nThis statement implies a correlation between the rise in the Dow and the purchasing behavior of rich individuals. While it is true that an increasing Dow generally indicates positive market sentiments and may encourage investors, including rich individuals, to buy more stocks, it cannot be concluded as a general rule. The purchasing behavior of rich people depends on various factors such as their investment strategies, risk appetite, and individual circumstances. Therefore, the statement might not be universally applicable.\n\nNow, considering these points, we can determine the plausible option:\n\n(A) Contradiction: This option is not appropriate because there is no direct opposition or contradiction between the two statements. \n\n(C) Entailment: This option also doesn't fit because the relationship between the two statements is not one of implication or logical consequence. The rise in the Dow does not necessarily entail that rich people will buy more.\n\nThus, the more plausible option is:\n\n(B) Neutral: This option is suitable because there is no inherent contradiction or entailment between the two statements. The correlation between the average industrial index of the Jones as a measure of industrial performance and the purchasing behavior of rich individuals when the Dow rises can vary and may not be universally applicable."}], "origin": {"sentence1": "Don 't ignore whether the average industrial index of Jones is a measure of industrial performance", "sentence2": "Dow Rising , rich people will buy more .", "choices": ["contradiction", "neutral", "entailment"], "answer": "neutral"}}
