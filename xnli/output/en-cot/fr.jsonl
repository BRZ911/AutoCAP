In this case, it would mean that the previous passage states explicitly that Mihdhar had a visa and came to the house. However, based on the information provided, we don't have any previous passage to consider.

Since we don't have any prior context, this option is plausible.\n\n(C) Entailment: This option means that the previous passage logically implies that Mihdhar never had a visa, so he couldn't have come to the house.

Cette option est possible, mais nous devons examiner l'autre possibilité avant de nous décider.\n\n- (C) Entailment (implication) : L'option d'implication suggère qu'il existe une relation de cause à effet entre l'arrêt des générateurs et la prévention d'un risque d'incendie.
